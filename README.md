# Zello for Paragliding Pilots

## Introduction

Zello is a modern and customizable walkie-talkie app (and more) that lives on any smart device.

Zello is a software application and uses a device's data connection or WiFi to transmit and receive voice data.
It is comparable to the voice message feature of many modern messaging apps, but Zello is much faster and easier to use for pilots.

Advantages of Zello over traditional walkie-talkies:

- Can be connected to multiple channels at the same time. Messages play in the order they were received.
- Free for non-commercial use.
- More than one party can 'broadcast' at the same time on a channel. One person cannot block transmission for others. Messages play in the order they were sent.
- Range is only limited by access to a data connection or WiFi. Can speak to pilots on the other side of the world.

Disadvantages of Zello over traditional walkie-talkies:

- Requires a smart device (smartphone, tablet, PC, etc.) and a data connection or WiFi.
- More complex to set up.
- Requires additional hardware for best operation (PTT button, headset & mic).

## TL;DR

Hardware requried:

- A bluetooth PTT button (searh for Zello Button on Ali Express/eBay)
- A bluetooth headset and mic (existing airpods, etc. work fine but please disable noise cancellation)

2. Pair the PTT button in Settings -> push-to-talk buttons
